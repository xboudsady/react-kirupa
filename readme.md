# React Micro Apps

## Todo App

Simple React app for a todo.  Type in a task or item, or whatever you want into the input field and then press Add (or click Enter / Return).  After submitted your item, you'll see it appear as an entry. You can keep adding items and have them all show up.

To remove an item, just lick on an existing entry.

This app mainly focus on simple form submission and state management to hold each entry in an array of tasks (objects).
